# Miskatonic
## About
Miskatonic is an adventure game engine for Android. It reads game structure and logic from an XML-based file format called ASTRAAL; logic is expressed through a weak DSL called AAL (Android Adventure Language). At the moment, this repository and the engine are written to support a game called The Hundred-Year Horror; however, a major milestone for continuing the project is removing any HYH-specific code and fully genericizing the engine.
